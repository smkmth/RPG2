This is where i am storing all the prefabs with the characters set up. 

They are in this folder because they are brought into a scene dynamically with the leveldata scriptable object. 

Dont add a character to the scene by just dragging a prefab into the scene, instead use the scenes leveldata, and just add another npc.

This way you can dynamically change who appears in a scene as you play.
