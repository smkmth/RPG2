This is where i keep all the prefabs i have used in the game. 

Markers are the things i use as transform coordinates, Ui is stuff used in the ui.

Scene Items is more specific. I use scene items as a place to put any objects the player picks up. 

These items should definately not just be dragged and dropped into a scene, and instead should be put into the leveldata scriptable object.

This is so i can dynamically remove the item after the player picks them up instead of it just constantly regenerating every time the level is loaded.
