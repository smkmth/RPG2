The scripts in this game are sorted by what objects the scripts themselves are put on. 

In The Scene scripts go on objects in the actual scene. 
Thats stuff like the script for NPCs, or a script which destroys items when they are picked up. 

Not used is my folder for useless scripts, orginally written for different builds of the game. I might need them later so i dont want to delete them, but they are not used in the game. 

OnThe_appObject is my folder for scripts which go on the _app object in the preload scene. This is where most of the scripts in the game are located.

Stuff like the player data script, a save/load script, GUI, character creation ect ect. 

Scriptable Objects is the folder i am using for setting up the scriptable objects in the game. 

These shouldnt need much messing around with really, you actually create scriptable objects by right clicking on the project panel and selecting from the create asset menu. 

This is just for tweeking what the scriptable objects actually do.
