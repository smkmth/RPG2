Manager folder
The scripts in the Manager folder are in the Manager Object. These are broad game wide controls, like the EventManager, GameState, GlobalItemHandler and LevelHandler.

Player Folder
The scripts in the Player folder are in the PlayerObj Object, a child of the Player object. These are things which specfically affect the player, like Player, PlayerRotation and Movement.

Static
There is currently only one script in the static folder, and it is the SaveLoadHandler, which is not on any object on the scene as it is a static object. 

DDOL 
Dont Destroy On Load. Its a script that stops the _app object from being destroyed on load. it is also the only script on the actual _app object.
